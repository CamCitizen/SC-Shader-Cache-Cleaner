# SC-Shader-Cache-Cleaner
A Simple Shader Cache Cleaner

I got tired of manually going to the Shader Cache folder for Star Citizen, so I made this batch file, which I eventually turned into an executable simply so I could add my own custom icon to it. 

There is nothing else embedded into this executable. The exe simply launches the .bat file within, lists the contents of  %localappdata%\Star Citizen\ and prompts you if you'd like to delete it or not. Once you select "Y" for Yes, the folder is purged of all files (which doesn't harm anything) and the program closes automatically. 

I've gone ahead and included both EXE and BAT files in the compressed ZIP, to leave it to the user to decide which they use. To see the code being used by the BAT file, simply open it here on GitHub, or once downloaded, right click the BAT file and choose "Open With. . ." and click Notepad.
